# Task-Parameterized-Gaussian-Mixture-Model

This is an clone of the original implementation of the Task-Parameterized-Gaussian-Mixture-Model by BatyaGG. The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/BatyaGG/Task-Parameterized-Gaussian-Mixture-Model)

In this implementation, I am creating a python package and organize a bit the code such that it can be easly used in other projects. The goal is to use this code as comparisons to other algorithms that I am developing. I do not have intention of contributing on TP-GMM.
